<h1>School</h1>


<p><strong>S</strong>chool is something,<br>
we must all embrace.<br>
Knowledge we need,<br>
to seek out and chase.</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>ubjects and teaching styles,<br> 
are plentiful and vary.<br>
Just like the backpacks,<br>
we all need to carry.</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>ports, clubs, and activities,<br>
at every single turn.<br>
So much to do,<br>
study and learn.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>o get the most from school,<br>
we should consistently attend.<br>
Around each corner,<br>
there's always a friend.</p>
